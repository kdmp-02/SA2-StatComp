### Summative Assessment 2: Statistical Computing

#### Data Meets Method: Collaborative Exploration of Advanced Resampling & Interference

We are a team of data scientists working for a research lab that investigates phenomena in fields ranging from healthcare to finance to climate science. The task is to select and investigate a real-wolrd dataset relevant to the interests, applying resampling and inferential techniques to extrack meanigful insights.
